# Atividade de Redes

This is a small example of socket programming that is able to connect multiple clients to a server using python 3 sockets. It can send messages from clients to server, and from server to clients. This example also shows how to host the socket server locally or globally across the internet so anyone can connect. This uses the python 3 socket and threading module.
